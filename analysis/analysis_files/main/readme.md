# (Exploration and Visualization of Prosper loans)
## (Patrick Ojunde)


## Dataset 
> The dataset is composed of 113,937 rows (uniquely idenifying a loan) and 81 variables that describes each loan some of which includes loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, and borrower income.

>> More information about this dataset can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0]


## Objective

> The objective of this analysis and visualization activity is to come up with interesting and actionable insghts from the loan data

> We also want to identify what features are suitable for predicting the success of a loan application



## General Summary & Insights

- Most Borrowers who are employed earn around 50k USD - 74,999k USD

- There are more Home Owners than Non Home Owners among our borrowers

- There are more employed borrowers than non-employed borrowers

-Majority of applicatns who have current & completed loans, falls under the Employed & Full-time Employment Status

- Borrowers with high credit rating (AA, A B) have higher chances of getting a loan than borrowers who do not

- Distribution of Monthly Income is right-skewed indicating a larger participation in borrowing by people with below avergae or averae monthly income

- Home Ownership and Gainful Employment serves as useful factors in predicting a successful loan application status

- Home Ownership and Gainful Employment are also useful predictors of loan interrest rate. Borrowers who satisfy these features tend to attract lower interest rate than thsoe who do not. This is not surprsing as higher risk attracts higher interest rate.

- The distribution of the loan origin amount was massively skewed to the right. with its highest peak between 4000-5000 USD

-The chart was right-skewed ondicating that most of the borrowers realtively are low income earners, significantly, they earn aroundn $100

## Conclusion & Limitations

One Limitation of this Exploratory Data Analysis is there are no delibeberte statistical analysis. The objective of the project lats more emphasis on the visualization aspect.

Statistical Analysis like Linear/logistic Regression woudl prove a value addition to the project but is quite beyond the scope of this project.

In conclusion, based on the various visualizations made in this notebook, factors for predicting succesful laon application include:

-   Borrower's Home Ownership
-   Borrower's Employment Status
-   Borrower's Monthly Income
-   Borrower's prosper (credit) rating
